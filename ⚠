I carve a heart around a C (around a C)

On the trunk of the tallest tree

I’m a leaf-shaped shadow

You’re the sun

Dear one

I would miss so much of the world (much of the world)

Without the way and all you see

In the deep time

I’m a leaf-shaped shadow

You’re the sun

Dear one

In the deep time

I’m a leaf-shaped shadow

You’re the sun

Dear one

I would miss so much of the world

Without the way and all you see

In the deep time

I’m a leaf-shaped shadow

You’re the sun
